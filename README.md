Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenRouter API key:
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

**5. Prepare Knowledge Base**
Organize your documents in a `my_knowledge_base/` directory:
```
my_knowledge_base/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.txt files (technical notes, quick references)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md files (documentation, personal stories)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.pdf files (academic papers, assignments)
